          This endpoint is disabled by default. To enable it for a given plugin,
          set

          `allow_get_invocation: true` in the plugin configuration.


          When invoked via GET:

          - `params` is an empty object (`{}`)

          - query parameters are passed to the plugin handler via
          `context.query`

          - wildcard route routing is supported the same way as POST (see
          `doc_call_plugin`)

          - Use the `route` query parameter or append the route to the URL path
