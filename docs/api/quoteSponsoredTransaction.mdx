          This endpoint provides fee estimation for transactions where the
          relayer will pay the network fees

          on behalf of the user. The user pays fees in a token of their choice
          (e.g., USDC) instead of the

          native network currency (e.g., XLM for Stellar).


          The endpoint accepts either a pre-built transaction XDR or a set of
          operations to build a transaction from.

          It returns the estimated fee amount in the specified fee token and the
          conversion rate from the native currency.
