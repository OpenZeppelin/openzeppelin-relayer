title: Execute a plugin with optional wildcard route routing

          Logs and traces are only returned when the plugin is configured with
          `emit_logs` / `emit_traces`.

          Plugin-provided errors are normalized into a consistent payload
          (`code`, `details`) and a derived

          message so downstream clients receive a stable shape regardless of how
          the handler threw.


          The endpoint supports wildcard route routing, allowing plugins to
          implement custom routing logic:

          - `/api/v1/plugins/{plugin_id}/call` - Default endpoint (route = "")

          - `/api/v1/plugins/{plugin_id}/call?route=/verify` - Custom route via
          query parameter

          - `/api/v1/plugins/{plugin_id}/call/verify` - Custom route via URL
          path (route = "/verify")


          The route is passed to the plugin handler via the `context.route`
          field.

          You can specify a custom route either by appending it to the URL path
          or by using the `route` query parameter.
