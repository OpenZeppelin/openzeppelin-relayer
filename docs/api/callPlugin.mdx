          Logs and traces are only returned when the plugin is configured with
          `emit_logs` / `emit_traces`.

          Plugin-provided errors are normalized into a consistent payload
          (`code`, `details`) and a derived

          message so downstream clients receive a stable shape regardless of how
          the handler threw.
