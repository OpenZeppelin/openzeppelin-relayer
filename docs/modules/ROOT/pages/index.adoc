== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites

* Rust 2021 edition
* Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

=== Installation

==== Local Setup

. Clone the repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/openzeppelin/openzeppelin-relayer
cd openzeppelin-relayer
----

. Install dependencies:

[source,bash]
----
cargo build
----

== Running the Relayer

=== Local Execution

[source,bash]
----
cargo run
----

=== Docker Deployment

The Relayer can be run as either a development or production container using the corresponding Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.development` or `Dockerfile.production`).

==== Environment Configuration

* Edit `.env` at the root of the repository to adjust environment variables
* The appropriate .env file will be included during image build

==== Building the Image

You can build using either standard Docker build or buildx:

[source,bash]
----
# Standard build
docker build --tag <your_image_tag> -f Dockerfile.<development | production> --squash-all

# Or using buildx
docker buildx build -f Dockerfile.<development | production> -t <name_of_image:tag> .
----

The build process will include:

* The appropriate .env file

==== Running the Container

You can use Docker Compose to run the container:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

For production runs, you can use:

[source,bash]
----
DOCKERFILE=Dockerfile.production docker-compose up
----
