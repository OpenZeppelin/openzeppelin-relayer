          This endpoint builds a transaction where the relayer will pay the
          network fees on behalf of the user.

          The user pays fees in a token of their choice (e.g., USDC) instead of
          the native network currency.


          The endpoint accepts either a pre-built transaction XDR or a set of
          operations to build a transaction from.

          It returns a prepared transaction that includes:

          - The transaction XDR (base64 encoded) ready for signing

          - The fee amount in both the fee token and native currency (stroops
          for Stellar)

          - The fee token identifier

          - The transaction validity timestamp


          After receiving the prepared transaction, the user must sign it and
          submit it through the standard

          transaction submission endpoint. For Stellar, the transaction will be
          wrapped in a fee-bump transaction

          where the relayer pays the network fees.
