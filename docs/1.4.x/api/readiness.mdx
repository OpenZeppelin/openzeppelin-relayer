          Returns 200 OK if the service is ready to accept traffic, or 503
          Service Unavailable if not.

          This endpoint is used for readiness probes in container orchestration
          platforms like

          AWS ECS or Kubernetes.


          ## Health Check Components


          - **System**: File descriptor usage, CLOSE_WAIT socket count

          - **Redis**: Primary and reader pool connectivity

          - **Queue**: Queue's Redis connections (separate from app's Redis)

          - **Plugins**: Plugin pool health, circuit breaker state, and
          connection metrics (if enabled)


          ## Status Levels


          - `healthy`: All components operational

          - `degraded`: Some components degraded but service can function (e.g.,
          reader pool down)

          - `unhealthy`: Critical components failed, service unavailable


          ## Plugin Connection Metrics


          When plugins are enabled, the following connection metrics are
          exposed:


          - `shared_socket_available_slots`: Number of additional concurrent
          plugin executions that can start

          - `shared_socket_active_connections`: Current number of active plugin
          execution connections

          - `shared_socket_registered_executions`: Number of plugin executions
          currently registered (awaiting response)

          - `connection_pool_available_slots`: Available connections to the pool
          server

          - `connection_pool_active_connections`: Active connections to the pool
          server


          These metrics help diagnose connection pool exhaustion and plugin
          capacity issues.


          ## Caching


          Health check results are cached for 10 seconds to prevent excessive
          load from frequent

          health checks. Multiple requests within the TTL return the same cached
          response.
